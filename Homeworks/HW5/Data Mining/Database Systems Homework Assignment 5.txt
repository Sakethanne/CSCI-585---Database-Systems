The Linear regression equation is as follows, The Linear Regression Model to predict the MEDV(class) value is.class =  -0.1084 * CRIM + 0.0458 * ZN +2.7187  * CHAS=1 +-17.376 * NOX + 3.8016 * RM +-1.4927 * DIS + 0.2996  * AD + -0.0118 * TAX +-0.9465 * PTRATIO + 0.0093 * B +-0.5226 * LSTAT + 36.3411In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models.As per the above linear regression equation, the MEDV(class) value depends on the following attributes, CRIM, ZN, CHAS, NOX, RM, DIS, AD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT and a constant 36.3411.Q2: What is the linear equation in the KNIME tool?Number of rings = -0.8249 * sex=I + 0.0577 * sex=M + -0.4583 * length + 11.0751 * diameter + 10.7615 * height + 8.9754 * whole _weight +  -19.7869 * shucked _weight + -10.5818? * viscera weight + 8.7418 * shell weight + 3.8946The above is the linear regression equation generated by the KNIME tool to predict the number of rings based on all the given attributes(columns) in the given data.Q3: What is the linear regression equation generated by the RapidMiner Studio tool?Number of rings =  -11.933 * length + 25.766 * diameter + 20.358 * height + 2.836The above is the linear regression equation generated by the RapidMiner Studio tool to predict the number of rings based on the fields length, diameter, and height attributes(columns) in the given data.
